This is my personal blog. You are welcome and more than welcome!

In my blog, I put most of my writtings here. My attitude to writing is largely influenced by my teachers in literature. Particularly, what Miss Tan in my high school told that writing is all about **traces imprints**. I would like to keep records of these words because they can help me trace back to the things, people, and surroundings that I have ever experienced. It proves by itself. Even at this moment, when I glance at the lines I wrote down in my high school, the feelings that I had resurfaces

Aphantasia, refering to a condition that certain individuals cannot voluntarily image visual pictures in their minds, is found to relate with weaker autobiliographical memories. I am this kind of person. I do find myself having trouble in recalling my own experience. Writing, the abstraction of sensory information, can help me a lot in finding who I was.

I try to make my blog meaningful to the greater goods. Otherwise, I can keep the documents private. It is always thrilling to have someone resonate with me, via Internet. The medium has bridged the actual me and actual others in a virtual way. The communication of netizens has been boosting the dissemination of knowledge, unimaginably. I truly recognize its power and appreciate the benefits I gained. It deserves advocates.

In terms of the content, most materials are Chinese at this moment. I have been urged to practice and imporove my writing (in academic setting), but using ESL and writing as much as possible will defenitly be a good approach. Thus, I will try to enrich my English blog :D Among these Chinese pieces, most are poetry. As the presentation of my turbulent feelings, those poems pin down my memories. Many strories in reality ended up bad ending, but the experiences persist. I would like to keep them here, like speaking to an empty valley. It echoes, but not have to be.

The idea of owning a website emerged when I was in mimddle school. The knowledge is mostly from my textbook for CS class, which usually was charged by teachers of "major" subject. When I went through the tiny textbook, it shows that how I can have a webpage.

That sounds cool.

It starts with Frontpage, an older program from Microsoft. Sooner, I gave up and turned to Dreamweaver by Adobe. Just as what I am doing nowadays, my first webpage is driven by serach engine, templates, and copy&paste. Unfortunately, I lost all the document at that stage. Moving on, I have a serious urge to have a website for my gang with whom I got along well. I have to made something collectively owned. Then, I started my exploration of Wordpress, a real blog platform. The work ended up a website named "Violet", suggesting our everlasting love to each other.

By then I learned knowledge about website maintainance, including domains, host, PHP, etc. However, just as most projects I had, they just failed someday without me knowing. Then, I started to learn various ways building a website.
